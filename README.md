This plugin adds a command that literally does nothing.

**WAIT, before you stop reading: this plugin still has a real use case!** It
allows you to disable system-hotkeys by mapping them to the `Do Nothing`
command. You can, for example, disable the `⌘Q` hotkey on macOS to avoid
accidentally quitting Obsidian.
